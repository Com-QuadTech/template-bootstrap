WHMCS Clientarea Bootstrap Template
=============

Clientarea template for use with the WHMCS billing software.

WHMCS Version: 5.3.9  
Bootstrap Version: 3.2.0  
jQuery Version: 1.11.1



Features
-----------

A few features that set this template apart from the default WHMCS template.

* HTML is clean and valid
* Includes full version of Bootstrap (css, javascript and images)
* Responsive design - This means the template will adjust and look great as well as be usable on devices other than desktop computers (ex: smartphones, tablets, and large displays).



Goal
-----------

My main goal with this project is to keep up-to-date with the latest releases of both Bootstrap and WHMCS.
